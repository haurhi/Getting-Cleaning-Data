# Getting-Cleaning-Data
Course Project

This is a code book for explaining the variable names. We have 180 observations of 68 variables in the ouput of the R script. Here are the explanations for the variable names in the tidy_set.txt.

### Subject

The subject, tagged as 1 to 30, comes from the test and train set.

### Activity

The body signals captured by the smarphone can be classified into 6 categories: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTARIS, WALKING_DOWNSTRAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

### Body signals
These signals are measured by the acclerometer and gyroscope and they fall into two domains: Time （prefix ‘time’） and Frequency (prefix ‘frequency). These set of body signals are estimated by the mean() and std() function. Here is the list of the signal names from the tidy_set.txt.
